## Task 1: Safety Concerns

Some emerging safety issues in the medical equipment and automotive industries are not given much attention because of the emphasis on speed of development and competition. In the automotive industry, the rapid advancement of electric and autonomous cars creates a problem of identifying new safety threats. Inerelated, in the medical device industry, it is also challenging to integrate cybersecurity into more traditional concepts of safety that were initially developed with regard to functional risks. In the interconnected devices of today’s world, such as in a hospital using IoT, safety risks may be compromised due to time constraints or lack of emphasis on cybersecurity (Puder et al., 2023).

Such changes in safety measures are usually occasioned by major accidents that occur in organizations. For instance, ransomware attacks in the healthcare segment in the COVID 19 pandemic era focused more improved cybersecurity measures such as several hospitals that experienced strikes on their operations (World Economic Forum, 2022). In the automotive industry, shifts occur after a major accident involving self-driving or smart cars, which reveals new risks that have not been considered before. Such incidents make both the industry and the regulators to step up the safety assessment and increase the standards (Daniel & Gardina, 2014). They lead to more elaborate safety processes, encompassing a range of issues: from the conventional to modern ones, starting with cybersecurity and ending with data leaks.

## Task 2: Static and Dynamic Analyzers


## Static vs. Dynamic Analyzers

Static and dynamic analyzers are two usable techniques applied to identify the software’s weaknesses; however, they operate differently. Static analysis is done without running the code through the computer’s operating system. It analyzes thes the code’s metallization, syntactic style, and logic to identify such problems as coding standard infringements, security flaws, with unreachable code (Veracode, 2024). It is mostly applied at the beginning of a series of development stages and provides immediate feedback to the developers. While static analysis is carried out on the code statically, then dynamic analysis is conducted while the code is executing. This method focuses on the B functioning when executing hence being effective when analyzing runtime abuses like memory leakage, race condition, and performance issues (Vfunction, 2024).

Benefits of utilizing these tools when production is ongoing are numerous. Static analysis assists in identifying most of the mistakes in these phases before they are introduced to later phases thus sparing the costs and time of fixing tedious problems later. It enhances the quality of the code as well as helps the user have a look at some security challenges when the software is not out. Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, is important in modeling operating conditions that are real-life-like. It reveals problems that are not apparent unless the program is in operation, for example, security concerns related to user input and sessions (Cypress Defense, 2024). Together, they offer a totally integrated, life cycle-based embrace of security.

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is one of the standard static testing techniques, which deals with analysis of source code to identify vulnerability without the execution of the application. While, for example, SAST can easily report on known positives such as SQL injection or buffer overflows, since it searches for it. Since it operates before the application is deployed, SAST is most effective in the development life cycle (Snyk, 2024).

## Task 3: Security Certification

Security certification of a product can include a number of rewards and penalties for the end user, the certifying bodies and the manufacturers of the product.

The good incentives of security certification from the end user’s perspective include; The end user is able to have confidence in the product since they are sure that it has met some standard of safety and security. Products labeled as certified particularly in areas like automotive or medical equipment denote a surety of compliance with high standards of production hence giving the consumer less risk to deal with. However, a bad incentive arises when certifications provide the perception of security. If authorizations are more or less used as sales tools with not many serious and frequent checks, the user, for instance, may think the product is secure, only to get a rude shock when the product is invaded by hackers (UST Education, 2024).

The good incentives for the certifying authority, whether vendor-funded or non-profit, are the ability to guarantee product safety and enhance the general standards of the industry. Vendor-funded certification must offer the means to create better and more detailed testing techniques. Since non-profit certifiers do not receive financial support from manufacturers, they can concentrate on the enhancement of security only (FATF, 2015). However, vendor-funded certifications may encourage certifying bodies to grant products a seal of approval because their funding comes from the manufacturers. This can lead to the question where the interest of the prospering company is placed, obscuring necessary security studies (Stanford, 2024).

From the manufacturer or designer’s point of view, a security certification can be a marketing tool that sets the product apart from other similar products. It shows concern for security and results in increased trust and sales. However, the cost of getting certification, particularly for small firms is a negative incentive. Furthermore, in the case of vendor-funded models, the manufacturers may be likely to obtain certifications that are less secure compared to those that enhance the security of the product thus making such certifications less valuable (UST Education, 2024).

Hence, while security certification can offer benefits in terms of safety and trust, the process is not without potential drawbacks, especially when financial incentives influence the thoroughness of certification.

## Task 4: NIS2 & RED

Main Goal of the Directive:

The main objective of NIS2 is to strengthen the cybersecurity in the EU by increasing the protection of the network and information systems of the essential and important entities. ES-HR CyRIC is intended to enhance incident reporting, analysis and handling of cybersecurity risks, threat and consequences, as well as cooperative action among member states of the EU in order to achieve a higher level of cybersecurity.

Types of Products Concerned:

NIS2 is mainly related to a network and information system which may involve digital services, telecommunication structures and facilities, data centers, cloud, and others that are central to the process.

Types of Organizations Concerned:

NIS2 applies to both essential entities, including energy, transport, healthcare, and financial services, and important entities, including providers of digital infrastructure, public electronic communication services, and some manufacturing industries. It also extends to medium and large organizations while excluding small organizations unless they are strategically important in supply chain networks.

Cybersecurity Measures for Compliance:

Being vulnerable, organisations must undertake activities like risk evaluations periodically, ways of managing the incidences, supply chain security procedures and contingency plans. Further, they need to have well-framed governance in relation to security, and the kind of security breach that has to be reported within 24 hours of occurrence and the post-breach assessment should also be done in a proper structure to allow for the best measures to be taken.

Compliance Date:

The NIS2 Directive must be implemented by organizations by October 2024, but there will be a grace period for organizations to adapt to the new rules.

Possible Penalties:

Sanctions in case of NIS2 non- compliance entail fines, which may not exceed € 10 million or 2% of the worldwide annual turnover. These fines are applicable to both necessary and significant entities that have not complied with the directive.

My Opinion:

NIS2 benefits society by setting a higher cybersecurity standard, reducing the likelihood of large-scale disruptions to critical services. It fosters greater resilience across industries and improves collaboration on cybersecurity issues. However, the cost and resource burden on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could be challenging, potentially requiring significant investment in security resources. Overall, the directive is a positive step toward a more secure digital ecosystem but might require additional support for smaller entities to comply effectively.
